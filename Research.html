       <!--  <h1 class="desc-heading white">Overview</h1>
      <p>In MG lab we have broad interest in developing new technologies for cargo delivery that are aimed at providing
        important
        clinical implications. In light of our strength and interest, we have developed two series of Cell Penetrating
        Peptides
        falling under the class of cationic and amphipathic groups. In order to design such peptides, we are engaged in
        understanding each of the cellular barriers faced by the nano-complexes starting from DNA condensation and
        formation of
        nanostructures to binding of the vector to the cell surface and finally culminating in the intracellular release
        of DNA
        in the nucleus. These peptides complex with plasmid DNA in nanoscale by electrostatic interactions. With
        interesting
        observations and leads we were able to modify the peptide sequence to maximize uptake and transfection
        efficiency. Under
        our radar we have the line of diversity from highly hydrophilic large molecules to highly hydrophobic small
        molecules to
        explore. We also share massive interest in understanding the peptides in bringing its efficiency. By and large
        we are
        devoted to applications in fields of prevention and treatment with respect to delivery of therapeutics.</p>

          <h3>Cationic and amphipathic peptides for efficient gene delivery:</h3>
          <p>One of the primary focus areas of the laboratory is to understand the basic tenets of efficient non-viral
            nucleic acid
            delivery. In this context, we have developed series of cationic and amphipathic peptides which can form
            nanocomplexes
            with different types of nucleic acids and deliver them efficiently to a wide range of cell types with
            minimal
            toxicity.
            The choice of amino acids, total charge, primary and secondary amphipathicity, total hydrophobicity and role
            of spacers
            were specific parameters that were looked into in this process. This was coupled with understanding of
            different
            barriers involved in the process of gene delivery- starting from understanding the mechanism of cellular
            entry,
            intracellular routing and retention, as well as the balance of condensation and release between the carrier
            and cargo.
            Currently, these systems are being adapted for delivery of not only plasmid DNA and siRNA but also RNP
            complexes in
            CRISPR-Cas systems.</p>

          <h3>Topical delivery to the skin using a peptide carrier:</h3>
          <p>Topical delivery of nucleic acids to skin has huge prospects towards therapeutic interventions for
            cutaneous disorders.
            The skin, however, poses a challenge for delivery of macromolecules because of its structure. The stratum
            corneum on top
            followed by the viable epidermis below â€“ do not allow easy passage of hydrophilic molecules like nucleic
            acids to
            efficiently enter the uncompromised skin. Our lab has developed an amphipathic peptide Mgpe9 that can
            penetrate the
            uncompromised skin utilizing multiple routes, enter skin cells and deliver plasmid DNA efficiently in vitro
            and in vivo.
            We observe efficient gene expression up to the basal layer of the skin without any observable toxic effects
            after
            delivery of reporter plasmids. The system can be effectively coupled with formulation bases like silicone
            oil-thereby
            improving the applicability. Currently we are working on application of this peptide for delivery of
            anti-freeze DNA to
            the skin towards prevention of cold-induced injuries. We have also attempted to use this method for delivery
            of other
            macromolecules to the skin.We have successfully complexed chondroitin sulfate, a type of glycosaminoglycan
            with
            important role in skin physiology, with an amphipathic peptide and showed its stability at physiological and acidic
            pH . The
            nanocomplexes were shown to enter skin cells and also demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
            properties in
            presence of UV irradiation. The nanocomplexes containing chondroitin sulphate could not only enter
            artificial skin
            membrane (mimicking the human skin), and mouse skin tissue unlike free chondroitin sulfate but also offer
            protection
            from UV-induced damage in mouse skin in vivo. Thus, a completely noninvasive method was devised to deliver a
            macromolecule into the skin without using injections or abrasive procedures.</p>

          <h3>Glycosaminoglycans: old players in new roles</h3>
          <p>Research in our laboratory has also helped us decipher novel roles of cell surface and exogenous
            glycosaminoglycans in
            cellular entry and intracellular trafficking of nanocomplexes. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) expressed
            ubiquitously on the
            cell surface are known to interact with a variety of ligands to mediate different cellular processes. We
            have shown that
            peptide chemistry is one of the key factors that determine the dependence on cell surface glycosaminoglycans
            for
            cellular internalization and gene delivery. On the other hand, exogenously added GAGs like chondroitin
            sulphate can be
            used to enhance the transfection efficiency of peptide-DNA nanocomplexes. A plethora of factors like
            enhanced stability
            of the nanocomplexes through formation of a coating, reduction of surface positive charge, different
            intracellular
            routing mechanism as well as altered endosomal escape have been found to be responsible for this. In
            addition, the
            nature of the peptide in the nanocomplex also plays a role. In light of this understanding, we are also
            looking into
            appropriate chemical modifications in chondroitin sulphate to enable penetration of mucus barrier and
            blood-brain
            barrier. We anticipate nanocomplexes coated with chemically modified CS to have important therapeutic
            implications in
            lung and brain gene delivery systems.</p>

          <h3>Multimodal action of inorganic and organic nanoparticles</h3>
          <p>Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures exhibit diverse chemical, biological, and clinical applications. Their
            unique properties
            like high refractive index and UV absorption over a wide wavelength range have been utilized for many
            applications in
            the field of biomedical science. One of the most common applications of ZnO is in the area of sunscreen
            agents. While
            microparticles are usually applied-their opaque appearance and restricted localization including possibility
            of washing
            off can be considered as potential drawbacks. ZnO nanoparticles can offer an alternative in this context.
            However,
            hydrolysis of ZnO nanoparticles in the skin folds leads to the formation of labile Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions,
            which permeate
            into viable
            epidermis and may elicit toxicity. Another major concern is the aggregation propensity of ZnO nanoparticles
            primarily in
            biological milieu. We have developed an amphipathic peptide-coated ZnO nanoparticle assembly for improved
            stabilization
            of the nanoparticles and studied their UV-protective activity. We observed that the peptide-modified
            nanoparticles
            showed lower aggregation, significant reduction in Zn<sup>2+</sup> leaching in vitro and even inside the
            cells for
            smaller
            particles, reduced photocatalytic activity, and reduced cellular phototoxicity under UV-B-treated
            conditions.</p>
          <p>We have also developed an antibacterial application using ZnO nanoparticles. Our strategy here was to
            develop a
            dispersion of ZnO nanoparticles in ionic liquids which showed superior antibacterial efficacy in comparison
            to that
            shown by the individual components. We also delved into the mechanism of killing of a skin-specific
            bacterium using this
            system and showed that this is possibly through the production of reactive oxygen species leading to
            bacterial cell
            lysis. Further, we showed that this formulation is biocompatible and nontoxic to normal keratinocyte cells
            even under
            coculture conditions.</p>
          <p>Currently we are also utilizing the leaching of Zn<sup>2+</sup> release from zinc oxide nanoparticles to
            selectively
            kill melanoma
            cells. A nanoassembly with a conjugated apoptotic peptide which can release in the intracellular conditions
            in cancer
            cells, coupled with the ROS generation through Zn<sup>2+</sup>leaching is being used to induce selective
            cell killing
            in melanoma
            model.</p>
          <p>Our laboratory is also delving into developing drug delivery solutions for Triple Negative Breast Cancer.
            Triple
            Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) refers to any subgroup of breast tumors that do not express the genes for
            estrogen
            receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and are
            therefore hard to
            target. Some novel therapeutics are like PARP, mTOR inhibitors, TRAIL receptor agonists, etc that try to
            bring about
            cancer cell death synergistically along with chemotherapeutic drugs are being developed. In all of the above
            cases,
            targeting is of utmost importance, in absence of which the treatment will harm the non-cancerous cells as
            well. We are
            currently developing multiple systems based on organic nanoparticle carrier that will deliver drugs
            selectively to
			      cancer cells.</p>
