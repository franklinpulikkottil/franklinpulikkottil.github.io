        <p>I have been working in the area of nanomaterials for biological applications. A PhD in Chemistry from Indian
          Institute
          of Science, Bangalore and Masters in Chemistry from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, I have built a research
          group at
          CSIR-IGIB since 2004 where me and my students have developed different nanocomplexes and nanoparticles for
          gene and drug
          delivery. One of our special focus areas is on developing new nanomaterials for cargo delivery to the skin. I
          have been
          a recipient of the National Bioscience Award for career development, Department of Biotechnology (2012) and am
          a SERB
          POWER fellow (Department of Science and Technology, 2021).

        <p>In the era of proteomics, genomics, and lipidomics, I am studying the sweet side of biology,
          ‘glycosaminoglycans’. Our
          lab is established in developing non-viral peptide-based transfection agents and has shown remarkable
          potential for
          topical application of one of these peptides. I am delving into utilizing this to deliver glycosaminoglycans
          to skin for
          preventing photodamage, accelerating wound healing and preventing skin cancer.

        <p>The curiosity about the interface of biology and chemistry led me to join this lab. As my lab has an
          upperhand for the
          perspective of delivery of different cargos to cells and tissue, I further took forward this work to modify
          and
          chemically conjugate the nanocomplexes used for gene delivery with mucus penetrating moieties to overcome the
          mucus
          barrier in Silicosis . I am also attempting to simultaneously deliver therapeutic anti-fibrotic nucleic acid
          to prevent
          fibrosis in Silicosis.

        <p>With the elucidation of potential carrier peptides in our lab, I plan to take the next step i.e. translating
          the current
          research into a topical formulation for skin related ailments. The area I am focusing upon is that of cold
          induced
          injuries, and plan to put forward a preventive therapy for the same. On the personal front, a Delhiite at
          heart, I enjoy
          exploring new places and the company of my family and friends anywhere and everywhere.

          also a part
          of the project where we tried to understand how surface modifications increase the stability of zinc oxide
          nanoparticles
          by monitoring its increasing biomedical applications. We as a team are also trying to explore the gene/protein
          delivery
          efficacy by cell penetrating peptides in different model systems.
